Armature Reaction
=================

#Although the armature-reaction mmf modifies the airgap flux-density, it does not figure in the torque expression unless it significantly affects the saturation level of the magnetic circuit . Physically the stator may be regarded as being incapable of producing torque on itself. The armature reaction flux does, however, rotate and induce a voltage drop in the phase windings, which must be overcome by the supply voltage.

.. important::

    In general, the emf generated by the filed flux always lags behind the field flux by 90 degree in any machine.
